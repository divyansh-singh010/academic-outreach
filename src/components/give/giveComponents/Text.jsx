				The lecture program called sci-tech spins that was launched on the 11st of september 2021 has received very
				encouraging response from students from across the country. The first talk was delivered in september 2021 by
				Prof. PV Madhusudhan Rao of the design department, and this was followed by three more talks by faculty members
				from the departments of civil, materials sciences and engineering, artificial intelligence, chemistry and
				physics. Every day, we receive numerous emails from schools and individual students with requests for
				registration in the series. The institute community has whole-heartedly thrown its weight behind this endeavor,
				with faculty members, post-doctoral fellows and research students volunteering for future lectures. It is
				needless to mention that as the institute carries on these events, costs will be incurred. The lectures are
				currently online, and there is Rising expenditure with venues, recording, and publicity materials. As the
				pandemic wanes, we will invite students to our campuses to attend these lectures and lab-sessions, even while we
				continue to live-stream these Lectures on youtube for the benefit of a larger community of students. The events
				may also occur more often.

				Our stem mentorship program is already underway. We have received tremendous response from various schools,
				individual students and parents, for the program. Due to this encouraging response, the institute is Looking at
				ways to expand the scope of this program to accommodate more girl students in the coming months. The academic
				outreach committee has worked out the initial expenses required for this program, in both forms â€“ residential
				and non-residential. While the mentorship currently is running in the online mode, we will soon shift to the
				physical mode, of course contingent on the overall pandemic conditions. The costs are expected to go up
				substantially once we move to the residential mode of the program. We solicit your help in this regard. Please
				contribute generously and help us run the mentorship program successfully. Every amount you pay towards this
				cause will help a girl student somewhere in india to achieve her dreams.
